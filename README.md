# Implementation-of-Tausworthe-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-
In this project I am going to focus on implementing the Tausworthe pseudo -random number generator with large value of r,q and l. 
# Installations
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook file in a jupyter environment or vscode
2. Run all cells in the .ipynb notebook to get results
3. From "testing with different inputs" onwards you can input your own values to run the algorithm and test it out
4. Packages required: numpy, seaborn, matplotlib,scipy(chi2,anderson,kstest,norm)
