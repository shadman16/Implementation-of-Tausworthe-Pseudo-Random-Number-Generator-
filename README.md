# Implementation-of-Tausworthe-Pseudo-Random-Number-Generator-
In this project I am going to focus on implementing the Tausworthe pseudo random number generator with large value of r,q and l.  For the 
goodness of fit of the generator I will use the Chi square method, Anderson Darling and Kolmogorov 
Smirnov tests. I also did the independence method taught in class, to show that the algorithm in fact was 
working for large values of r,l and q.
# Installations
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook file in a jupyter environment or vscode
2. Run all cells in the .ipynb notebook to get results
3. From "testing with different inputs" onwards you can input your own values to run the algorithm and test it out
4. Packages required: numpy, seaborn, matplotlib,scipy(chi2,anderson,kstest,norm)
